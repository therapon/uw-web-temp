Files in this directory, and ../css/calendar.css are designed to 
help you to use this template with createcal.  To integrate with the 
createcal calendar, follow these steps:

1. Copy calendar.template into <course_web>/calendar/htmlTemplates/,
replacing the default calendar.template there.

2. Run createcal as normal to generate calendar.html.

3. In this example, we are replacing the schedule page with the createcal calendar.
First remove or rename schedule/index.html, then recreate it as a symlink to calendar.html
   cd <course_web>/schedule
   ln -s ../calendar/calendar.html index.html

Now you may update/regenerate the calendar as normal.

If you use other createcal features such as the section list, the homework 
list, etc. you may also want to copy the corresponding templates to htmlTemplates, 
and create additional symlinks to corresponding creatcal html output.

You may also edit the templates if you desire to change the titles, style, or layout.
